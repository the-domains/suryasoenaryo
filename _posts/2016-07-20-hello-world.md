# Hello, world!

Hello, world! hello, everyone!

This is my first post, yet I don't know what I should read in this post. So, I will introduce myself.

Hi, my name is Soen, Surya Soenaryo. That's my Indonesian name--- my registered name. But, I also have a Chinese name, called 孙健伟. "Soen" is my Chinese surname in Indonesia, which usually called as "Sun". Because of traditional dialect from Indonesia, we changed "u" into "oe". Anyway, you may can me either of that, feel free!

And yes, I was born in Indonesia. Both of my great-grandparents were an immigrant from China. That's why I have 2 name at the same time, and I proud of it. My hometown is Semarang-City, A city that famous for the traditional food called "Lunpia", or we usually called as "Spring Roll". I lived on there until graduated from high school, and then I have been staying in Surabaya-city to take my bachelor degree at Petra Christian University in Department of Informatics, Business Information System Program.

Even I have a Chinese family background, I couldn't be able to speak Chinese language fluently. Yes, I have started to learn Mandarin (Chinese language) for 6 years since my 1st year of Junior High School. After I graduated from my high school, I never used it again and gradually, my Chinese language proficiency had totally gone. Even so, after I met so much occasion, I have been starting to learn Chinese language again.

Anyway, I can speak in Indonesian language, Mix-Indonesian language (official one + traditional Javanese language), English, and Japanese language--- yes! I have learnt Japanese language, and this is one of my reason why I wanted to re-learn Chinese language again. Because Japanese - Chinese - Korean language had some kind of similarity, and I was learning 3 of them currently--- even I more confidence on my Japanese language than the others. If you have this kind of similar interest with me, please let me know and let's improve ourselves together!

> 一期一会、ですから常に今回を大切に

I like this proverb--- my favorite one! It's quite hard to translate it into another language. But, it has some kind of meaning that every occurrence in our life will create our memoir. Each person that we had met before might gave some kind of influence in our life, whether we realized or not, from an unexpected moment or not, we like that person or not, let's keep it as our important experience.

I think that's it for my first post. I don't know what I may post in the further, maybe some kind of topics that I interested or some of my past-work, or what.

Cheers!
